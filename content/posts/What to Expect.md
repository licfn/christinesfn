Hello and welcome to <em>CfN</em>. Here, I’ll be sharing my thoughts and observations, much like one would jot down in a field note. You can expect a wide range of topics, from books and films to everyday happenings. I hope to explore these subjects with the openness and curiosity of a three-year-old. You'll often find me asking ‘why’ and ‘what does that mean?’  
  
My posts will reflect my current thinking, meaning that the thoughts I express on here are inchoate and always open to revision and refinement. I see <em>CfN</em> as a great way to document that evolution.  
  
I also welcome your comments and thoughts. <em>CfN</em> is meant to be a space for conversation, not just my own views. Your comments are valuable and can help shape and inform my thinking.
